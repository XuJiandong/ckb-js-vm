# @ckb-js-std@/bindings

This package contains declarations of binding functions which are implemented in
ckb-js-vm using C programming language. The bindings package serves as a bridge
between JavaScript and the native C implementations in ckb-js-vm, providing
efficient low-level operations and system calls.
