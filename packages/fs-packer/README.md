In addition to executing individual JavaScript files, ckb-js-vm also supports JavaScript modules through its Simple File System. Files within this file system are made available for JavaScript to read, import, and execute, enabling module imports like import { * } from "./module.js". Each Simple File System must contain at least one entry file named index.bc (or index.js), which ckb-js-vm loads from any cell and executes.

A file system is represented as a binary file with a specific format described in this document. You can use the ckb-fs-packer tool to create a file system from your source files or to unpack an existing file system.
